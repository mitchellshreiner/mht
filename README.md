# Multiple Hypothesis Tracking
This is an implementation of the Multiple Hypothesis Tracking filter,
implemented for educational purposes and for the purpose of the article
''Spatially Indexed Clustering for Scalable Tracking of Remotely Sensed Drift
Ice'' accepted for the IEEE Aerospace 2017 conference, Big Sky, MT.

In particular, this implementation studies the use of Spatial Indexing in the
MHT clustering process.

In addition to this implementation the following fork includes documentation for setup and more tests using datasets from the MOT Challenge website (https://motchallenge.net/).
